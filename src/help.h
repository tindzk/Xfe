\n \
\n \
\n \
  Drag and Drop operations\n \
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n \
\n \
 Dragging a file or group or files (by moving the mouse while maintaining the left button pressed)\n \
 to a directory or a file panel optionally opens a dialog that allows to select the file operation: copy,\n \
 move, link or cancel.\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Trash system\n \
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=\n \
\n \
 Starting with version 1.32, xfe implements a trash system that is fully compliant with the freedesktop.org standards.\n \
 This allows the user to move files to the trash can and to restore files from within xfe or your favorite\n \
 desktop.\n \
 Note that the trash files location is now: ~/.local/share/Trash/files\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Configuration\n \
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=\n \
\n \
 You can perform any xfe customization (layout, file associations, key bindings, etc.) without editing any file\n \
 by hand. However, you may want to understand the configuration principles, because some customizations can also\n \
 easily be done by manually editing the configurations files.\n \
 Be careful to quit xfe before manually editing any configuration file, otherwise changes could not be taken\n \
 into account.\n \
\n \
 The system-wide configuration file xferc is located in /usr/share/xfe, /usr/local/share/xfe\n \
 or /opt/local/share/xfe, in the given order of precedence.\n \
\n \
 Starting with version 1.32, the location of the local configuration files has changed. This is to be compliant\n \
 with the freedesktop.org standards.\n \
 \n \
 The local configuration files for xfe, xfw, xfv, xfi, xfp are now located in the ~/.config/xfe directory.\n \
 They are named xferc, xfwrc, xfvrc, xfirc and xfprc.\n \
 \n \
 At the very first xfe run, the system-wide configuration file is copied into the local configuration file\n \
 ~/.config/xfe/xferc which does not exists yet. If the system-wide configuration file is not found\n \
 (in case of an unusal install place), a dialog asks the user to select the right place. It is thus easier to\n \
 customize xfe (this is particularly true for the file associations) by hand editing because all the local options are\n \
 located in the same file.\n \
\n \
 Default PNG icons are located in /usr/share/xfe/icons/xfe-theme or /usr/local/share/xfe/icons/xfe-theme, depending\n \
 on your installation. You can easily change the icon theme path in Preferences dialog.\n \
 \n \
\n \
\n \
  Tips\n \
  =-=-=\n \
\n \
 File list\n \
    - Select files and right click to open a context menu on the selected files\n \
    - Press Ctrl + right click to open a context menu on the file panel\n \
    - When dragging a file/folder to a folder, hold on the mouse on the folder to open it\n \
\n \
 Tree list\n \
    - Select a folder and right click to open a context menu on the selected folder\n \
    - Press Ctrl + right click to open a context menu on the tree panel\n \
    - When dragging a file/folder to a folder, hold on the mouse on the folder to expand it\n \
\n \
 Copy/paste file names\n \
    - Select a file and press Ctrl-C to copy its name into the clipboard. Then in a dialog,press Ctrl-V to paste\n \
      the file name.\n \
    - In a file operation dialog, select a filename in the line containing the source name and paste it directly\n \
      to the destination using the middle button of your mouse. Then modify it to suit your needs.\n \
\n \
 Startup notification\n \
    - If Xfe was compiled with startup notification support, the user can disable it for all applications at the global\n \
      Preferences level. He can also disable it for individual applications, by using the dedicated option in the first\n \
      tab of the Properties dialog. This latter way is only available when the file is an executable.\n \
      Disabling startup notification can be useful when starting an old application that doesn't support the startup\n \
      notification protocol (e.g. Xterm).\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Bugs\n \
  =-=-=\n \
\n \
 Please report any found bug to Roland Baudin <roland65@free.fr>. Don't forget to mention the xfe version you use,\n \
 the FOX library version and your system name and version.\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Translations\n \
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=\n \
 \n \
 xfe is now available in 19 languages but some translations are only partial. To translate xfe to your language,\n \
 open the xfe.pot file located in the po directory of the source tree with a software like poedit, kbabel\n \
 or gtranslator and fill it with your translated strings (be careful to the hotkeys and c-format characters),\n \
 and then send it back to me. I'll be pleased to integrate your work in the next xfe release.\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Patches\n \
  =-=-=-=\n \
\n \
 If you have coded some interesting patch, please send it to me, I will try to include it in the next release...\n \
\n \
\n \
 Many thanks to Maxim Baranov for his excellent X Win Commander and to all people that have provided useful\n \
 patches, translations, tests and advices.\n \
