 Icons were taken from different file managers and desktops: gentoo, xplore, dfm, nautilus, Gnome, KDE, XFCE
 and some of them were modified.

 This software uses the FOX Toolkit Library (http://www.fox-toolkit.org).
 
 
 *IMPORTANT REMARKS *
 
 1. You must use the current stable Fox version 1.6.36 (required!) or higher in the 1.6.x branch. 
 The current version of xfe neither can be build using the Fox 1.0.x, 1.2.x, 1.4.x, nor using the 1.7.x series.
 
 2. UTF-8 is now supported, thus check that your LANG environment variable is set to be UTF-8 compliant otherwise
 accents and special characters could be wrong displayed. For composed characters to work (like ü or ê),
	Fox *must* be compiled with the --with-xim configure option.

 Drag and Drop operations
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
  Dragging a file or group or files (by moving the mouse while maintaining the left button pressed)
  to a directory or a file panel optionally opens a dialog that allows to select the file operation: copy,
  move, link or cancel.



 Trash system
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
  Starting with version 1.32, xfe implements a trash system that is fully compliant with the Freedesktop standards.
  This allows the user to move files to the trash can and to restore files from it, from within xfe or your favorite
  desktop.
  Note that the trash files location is now: $home/.local/share/Trash/files



 Configuration
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
  You can perform any xfe customization (layout, file associations, key bindings, etc.) without editing any file
  by hand. However, you may want to understand the configuration principles, because some customizations can also
  easily be done by manually editing the configurations files.
  Be careful to quit xfe before manually editing any configuration file, otherwise changes could not be taken
  into account.

  The system-wide configuration file xferc is located in /usr/share/xfe, /usr/local/share/xfe
  or /opt/local/share/xfe, in the given order of precedence. 

  Starting with version 1.32, the location of the local configuration files has changed. This is to be compliant
  with the Freedesktop standards.
  
  The local configuration files for xfe, xfw, xfv, xfi, xfp are now located in the ~/.config/xfe directory.
  They are named xferc, xfwrc, xfvrc, xfirc and xfprc.
  
  At the very first xfe run, the system-wide configuration file is copied into the local configuration file
  ~/.config/xfe/xferc which does not exists yet. If the system-wide configuration file is not found
  (in case of an unusal install place), a dialog asks the user to select the right place. It is thus easier to
  customize xfe (this is particularly true for the file associations) by hand editing because all the local options are
  located in the same file.

  Default PNG icons are located in /usr/share/xfe/icons/xfe-theme or /usr/local/share/xfe/icons/xfe-theme, depending
  on your installation. You can easily change the icon theme path in Preferences dialog. 
  


 Tips
 =-=-=
 
  File list
    - Select files and right click to open a context menu on the selected files
    - Press Ctrl + right click to open a context menu on the file panel
    - When dragging a file/folder to a folder, hold on the mouse on the folder to open it

  Tree list
    - Select a folder and right click to open a context menu on the selected folder
    - Press Ctrl + right click to open a context menu on the tree panel
    - When dragging a file/folder to a folder, hold on the mouse on the folder to expand it

  Copy/paste file names
    - Select a file and press Ctrl-C to copy its name into the clipboard. Then in a dialog,press Ctrl-V to paste
      the file name.
    - In a file operation dialog, select a filename in the line containing the source name and paste it directly
      to the destination using the middle button of your mouse. Then modify it to suit your needs.
      
  Startup notification
    - If Xfe was compiled with startup notification support, the user can disable it for all applications at the global
      Preferences level. He can also disable it for individual applications, by using the dedicated option in the first
      tab of the Properties dialog. This latter way is only available when the file is an executable.
      Disabling startup notification can be useful when starting an old application that doesn't support the startup
      notification protocol (e.g. Xterm).   
     



 Install from sources
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Type:
    ./configure
     make
     make install
  
  or use the RPM package for Redhat and compatible Linux distributions, or the deb package for Debian
  and compatible distributions.



 Build an RPM package
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  You first need the correct fox-1.6.x and fox-devel-1.6.x packages to be installed.

  To create an RPM package from the xfe sources, simply type:
    rpmbuild -ta xfe-VVV.tar.gz

  where VVV is the xfe version number (e.g. 0.80).
 
  The created RPM package xfe-VVV-1.i386.rpm is usually located in /usr/src/rpm/RPM/i386, but this
  may vary depending on your distribution and/or your customizations.
 
  To install the created RPM package xfe-VVV-1.i386.rpm, enter the following command (as root):
    rpm -Uvh xfe-VVV-1.i386.rpm
 
 
 
 Build a Debian package
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  You first need the correct libfox1.6 and libfox1.6-dev packages to be installed.
 
  Extract the sources and enter the source directory:
    tar zxvf xfe-VVV.tar.gz
    cd xfe-VVV
 
  Then, build the Debian package (no need to sign the package, thus the -uc -us options):
    fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us
 
  And finally, install the created package (as root):
    cd ..
    dpkg -i xfe_VVV-1_i386.deb



 Build a self extracting package
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
  You first need the correct FOX libraries 1.6.x installed and working on your system.
 
  First, extract the sources and enter the source directory:
    tar zxvf xfe-VVV.tar.gz
    cd xfe-VVV
 
  Create the required shell scripts makesfx.sh, header.sh and sfx.sh:
    ./configure
 
  Create the self extracting binary package:
    sh makesfx.sh
 
  And finally, install it to /usr/local (as root):
    sh xfe-VVV-i386.sh



 Bugs
 =-=-=
 
  Please report any found bug to Roland Baudin <roland65@free.fr>. Don't forget to mention the xfe version you use,
  the FOX library version and your system name and version.

 
 
 Translations
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=
  
  xfe is now available in 19 languages but some translations are only partial. To translate xfe to your language,
  open the xfe.pot file located in the po directory of the source tree with a software like poedit, kbabel
  or gtranslator and fill it with your translated strings (be careful to the hotkeys and c-format characters),
  and then send it back to me. I'll be pleased to integrate your work in the next xfe release.
 
 
 
 Patches
 =-=-=-=
 
  If you have coded some interesting patch, please send it to me, I will try to include it in the next release...


 Enjoy!
 
  Many thanks to Maxim Baranov for his excellent X Win Commander and to all people that have provided useful
  patches, translations, tests and advices.
