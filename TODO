TODO list and known issues

Critical bugs
--------------



Known issues
------------

- if the mouse pointer is on a menu title, then it is not possible to navigate using the keyboard on the menu titles.
  This is a FOX issue.
- in Xfw, if the wordwrap mode is selected an line numbers are displayed, then the line numbers are uncorrectly
  displayed for wrapped lines. This is also a FOX issue.



To do
------

- add a way to clean history lists (like the open file list, for example)
- internationalization of man files
- internationalization should handle multiple plural forms (required by languages like polish, czech, etc.)
- at the command line, Xfe should handle file names (and URIs) and open the associated application to open the file names
  (ex: xfe test.txt should edit the test.txt file, xfe /usr/bin/gimp should launch gimp, etc.)
- places (home + trash + mtab entries) and bookmark items could be displayed as a tab pane in the tree panel
- in detailed view, the user should have the ability to select the displayed columns
- add an option to set the default archive format
- file searching dialog (work already started but not completed yet) 
- use of MIME types in complement to file associations
- implement lenghty operations in background (directory size, thumbnails, copy...)
- indicator of global progress of file operations when multiple items have been selected
- simple archive program or implement VFS?
- df command (disk usage, on Linux only?)


User requests
--------------

- autosize file name header in detailed view
- context menus on text dialogs
- hotkeys to go directly to a directory
- implement users scripts (like in Nautilus)
- Samba support (network neighborhood, using Fuse?)
